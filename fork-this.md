# Fork on The Range

![forking the range](images/ranch.jpg  "home on the range")

An [experiment](http://cogdogblog.com/2016/04/github-forking/) to see what it will take for people to fork a repo, by rewriting a line from the old (and thus public domain) [Home On the Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_on_the_Range) the version by Dr. Brewster Higley (1876).

Better yet, [go to the repo](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/tree/gh-pages) and fork (edit) [fork-this.md](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/fork-this.md) to edit this very file. It's in Markdown, which you do not need to know, just edit any part of the lyrics below. It's more fun to edit just a few lines, but hey, the only person stopping you is you.

Notice that the pattern is:

1. Intro line with it's own rhyming couplet (**_home_** and **_roam_**)  "Oh, give me a **_home_** where the Buffalo **_roam_**"
2. Second line that builds and ends in a different rhyme worthy word "Where the deer and the antelope **_play_**"
3. Third line with another couplet pair (**_heard_** and **_word_**), same rhythm as line 1 "Where seldom is **_heard_** a discouraging **_word_**"
4. Fourth line matches and rhymes with line 2 "And the sky is not cloudy all **_day_**"

*EDIT BELOW THE LINE, OK?, each of the sections inside the ``` marks*

## Fork on the Range (a new GitHub Classic)

```
Oh, fork me a repo where the edits go
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is fomented a negative comment,
And the remixes happen all day.
```

```
------------ CHORUS ------------
A repo! A repo!
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the sky is not cloudy all day.
------------ CHORUS ------------
```

```
Oh! give me a space where the code kids race
Throws its light from the glittering streams,
Where glideth along the graceful white swan,
Like the maid in her heavenly dreams.

```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
Oh! give me a chance to make a new branch,
Where the where the rhymes get worse every day;
On the banks of the Server, where always if never,
This old git plays with git his own way.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
How often at night, when the heavens were bright,
With the light of the twinkling stars
Have I stood here amazed, and asked as I gazed,
If their glory exceed that of ours.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours,
I love the wild curlew's shrill scream;
The bluffs and white rocks, and antelope flocks
That graze on the mountains so green.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```

This is just to [say](google.ca) that I edited this part in my text editor
And pushed it through the Github app...
Because that would make more people comfortable... maybe...?
You wouldn't even need to interface w/ Github beyond the initial clone.

```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
Oh fork me some code like a palindrome node
where it's fly, not dowdy or frayed.
Where seldom there's Word, or a Micro$oft Nerd
and the cry is never dismayed.
```
**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
It's a cold Friday morn and wool socks need be worn
To make sure your old toes don't turn blue
The rain and the snow need to pack up and go
'Cause it's April and we want something new.
```
