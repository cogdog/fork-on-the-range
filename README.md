# Fork on The Range
An experiment to see what it will take for people to fork a repo, by rewriting a line from an old song. See what's up at http://cogdog.github.io/fork-on-the-range

Better yet, [go to the repo](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/tree/gh-pages) and fork [fork-this.md](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/fork-this.md) to edit part of the song. 

[For fine viewing, see the forkage](https://docsify.cogdog.casa/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/gh-pages&homepage=fork-this.md&edit-link=https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/fork-this.md#/) rendered with [Docsify This](https://docsify-this.net/)

What are you waiting for? *Get forking!*
