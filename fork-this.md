# Fork on The Range

![forking the range](images/ranch.jpg  "home on the range")

An [experiment]() to see what it will take for people to fork a repo, by rewriting a line from the old (and thus public domain) [Home On the Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_on_the_Range) the version by Dr. Brewster Higley (1876). 

Better yet, [go to the repo](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/tree/gh-pages) and fork (edit) [fork-this.md](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/fork-this.md) to edit this very file. It's in Markdown, which you do not need to know, just edit any part of the lyrics below. It's more fun to edit just a few lines, but hey, the only person stopping you is you.

Notice that the pattern is:

1. Intro line with it's own rhyming couplet (**_home_** and **_roam_**)  "Oh, give me a **_home_** where the Buffalo **_roam_**"
2. Second Like that builds and ends in a different rhyme worthy word "Where the deer and the antelope **_play_**"
3. Third line with another couplet pair (**_heard_** and **_word_**), same rhythm as line 1 "Where seldom is **_heard_** a discouraging **_word_**"
4. Fourth line matches and rhymes with line 2 "And the sky is not cloudy all **_day_**"

*EDIT BELOW THE LINE, OK?, each of the sections inside the ``` marks*

## Fork on the Range (a new GitHub Classic)

```
Oh, fork me a repo where the edits go
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is fomented a negative comment,
And the remixes happen all day.
```

```
------------ CHORUS ------------ 
A repo! A repo!
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the sky is not cloudy all day.
------------ CHORUS ------------ 
```

```
Oh! give me a space where the code kids race
Throws its light from the glittering streams,
Where glideth along the graceful white swan,
Like the maid in her heavenly dreams.

```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
Oh! give me a chance to make a new branch,
Where the where the rhymes get worse every day;
On the banks of the Server, where always if never,
This old git plays with git his own way.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
How often at night, when the heavens were bright,
With the light of the twinkling stars
Have I stood here amazed, and asked as I gazed,
If their glory exceed that of ours.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```
I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours,
I love the wild curlew's shrill scream;
The bluffs and white rocks, and antelope flocks
That graze on the mountains so green.
```

**------------ CHORUS ------------**

```

This is just to [say](google.ca) that I edited this part in my text editor
And pushed it through the Github app...
Because that would make more people comfortable... maybe...?
You wouldn't even need to interface w/ Github beyond the initial clone.

```
